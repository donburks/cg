# Fantasy map generator

This is code for generating fantasy maps in an Electron app, which can then be exported to PNGs. 

## FULL DISCLOSURE

This is an amalgamation of work that has been done by other smart people. I cannot take credit for the terrain generation, the language generation, or the code to save as a PNG. I am merely the assembler of these technologies into this particular whole. 

This project was done as a present for someone. 

The terrain is generated using the algorithm behind [@unchartedatlas][uncharted]. For more details, see [these notes][notes].
The PNGs are generated by a library taken from [here][svg].
